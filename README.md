# Example workflow for the analysis of individual-level smoking interventions
The code in this repo is part of the STAPM programme of modelling. STAPM was created as part of a programme of work on the health economics of tobacco and alcohol at the School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR), The University of Sheffield. This programme is based around the construction of the Sheffield Tobacco and Alcohol Policy Model (STAPM), which aims to use comparable methodologies to evaluate the impacts of tobacco and alcohol policies, and investigate the consequences of clustering and interactions between tobacco and alcohol consumption behaviours. See the [STAPM webpage](https://stapm.gitlab.io/).   

The code in this repo is designed to support our analyst team to understand how to run the model for the purposes of understanding the effects of individual-level smoking interventions - by providing a worked example of the entire workflow. This example shows how to model the effect of an intervention that makes smokers more likely to quit. Outcomes are forecast over the remaining lifetimes of the people who are exposed to the intervention.   

Developments are still being worked through, so the code in this repo is likely to change. The code and documentation are still undergoing internal review by the analyst team. At the moment only members of our project team are able to run this code because it depends on a number of private R packages.
