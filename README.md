# Example workflow for the analysis of individual-level smoking interventions
The code in this repo is part of the STAPM programme of modelling. STAPM was created as part of a programme of work on the health economics of tobacco and alcohol at the School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR), The University of Sheffield. This programme is based around the construction of the Sheffield Tobacco and Alcohol Policy Model (STAPM), which aims to use comparable methodologies to evaluate the impacts of tobacco and alcohol policies, and investigate the consequences of clustering and interactions between tobacco and alcohol consumption behaviours. See the [STAPM webpage](https://stapm.gitlab.io/).   

The code in this repo is designed to support our analyst team to understand how to run the model for the purposes of understanding the effects of individual-level smoking interventions - by providing a worked example of the entire workflow. This example shows how to model the effect of an intervention that makes smokers more likely to quit. Outcomes are forecast over the remaining lifetimes of the people who are exposed to the intervention.   

Developments are still being worked through, so the code in this repo is likely to change. The code and documentation are still undergoing internal review by the analyst team.   

## Setup
At the moment only members of our project team are able to run this code because it depends on a number of [private R packages](https://stapm.gitlab.io/software.html). To access these packages you will need to sign-up for a Gitlab account and then let Duncan Gillespie know your username so that you can be added to our team.   

Please make sure your STAPM R packages are up to data before running this code. The versions of the STAPM R packages that are used for this example are given in `src/05_install_packages.R`. If you need to install a more up to date version, run `remove.packages()` first to get rid of the old version, then run the code to install the version required.   

## Code
To run the code yourself, you will need to 'clone' the code in this repo to your own computer -- we have made [a video to show how to do this](https://digitalmedia.sheffield.ac.uk/media/1_ji3vrs1s). If you can get this example running on your own machine, then you deserve a treat.   

## Data
There are two options for getting access to the data required to run the code in this repo.  

**If you want to create the data inputs from the raw data**, then you will need to be given access to the University of Sheffield's X-drive folders `PR_Consumption_TA` and `PR_mortality_data_TA`. This will allow you to run the code files `10_clean_hse.R`, `15_prep_mortality.R` and `20_estimate_smoking_transition_probabilities.R`.    

Some of the data used is pre-processed in a secure environment because it contains sensitive information. It is only made available to inform our modelling once it has been summarised into aggregated, non-sensitive form. The code files `25_prep_morbidity.R`, `26_prep_multiplier_data.R`, `27_prep_unit_cost_data.R`, `28_prep_utility_data.R` all read pre-processed data and do some small tweeks to get it into a form ready for use in our modelling.    

**You can use ready-made data to run the model**. The data files that you will need are stored in the X-drive folder `PR_STAPM/Data/smoking_intervention_analysis` (same name as this repo). Copy the files there to the folder `intermediate_data`. You can then run the code `30_run_simulation.R` without having to run the code files that create the data inputs.    

The **inputs** are:   

1.  A population data sample with details of tobacco consumption from the Health Survey for England. These data are for ages 11--89 years and years 2001--2016. The data have had missing values for key socio-economic variables imputed.   
2.  Smoking transition probabilities - three files covering smoking initiation, quitting and relapse.   
3.  Cause-specific rates of mortality and morbidity.  
4.  Data on the frequency and cost of hospital admissions.   
5.  Health state utility values.   

## Processes in the simulation of smoking behaviour
The model is run by the function `stapmr::SmokeSim()`. This function can recapitulate the past trends in smoking observed in the HSE, allowing validation of the model predictions against the observed data. It also allows the forecasting of future smoking, based on our forecasts of the smoking transition probabilities.    

The smoking model is an individual-based simulation of the population dynamics of smoking (see the [mathematical model framework](https://stapm.gitlab.io/stapmr/articles/smoking_model_maths.html)). The model simulates individual movements among current, former and never smoking states as they age. The simulation proceeds in one year time steps. At each time step, a sample of new individuals are added to the simulated population at the youngest age of 11 years. In each year of the simulation, **survival** is simulated by assigning each individual a relative risk for each disease based on their smoking state; individuals are then removed from the population according to their probabilities of death from each disease, accounting for differential risk by smoking status. **Behaviour change** is simulated in terms of individual transitions among smoking states, and time since quitting for former smokers is updated; each individual is assigned the smoking transition probability that matches their age, sex and IMD quintile for the year being simulated. **Demographic change** is simulated by ageing individuals by one year, and adding new individuals at the youngest age; the number of individuals added at the youngest age in each year is proportional to either the observed or [projected population sizes](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationprojections) (based on the primary population projection) for that age and year.    

The whole model is stratified by sex and socio-economic conditions (where we define socio-economic conditions in terms of Index of Multiple Deprivation quintiles).     

##Â The example intervention modelled to illustrate the code
The intervention modelled in this example has been kept as simple as possible. For more complicated interventions and patient pathways, the `stapmr::SmokeSim()` function could be adapted, or further code developed outside of `stapmr::SmokeSim()`. We model an intervention that is offered to 90\% of smokers aged 55-74 years from 2010 to 2015, that is accepted by 75\% of smokers it is offered to. The intervention is assumed to double to probability that the smokers who receive it during a one year time step in the model will be observed as a former smoker at the next time step.   

## Output
The main **output** of these processes is a simulated individual-level dataset of tobacco consumption from the baseline year (2002) to the time horizon of the forecast (2050). The model simulates a `control` arm - without the effect of the intervention, and a `treatment` arm - with the effect of the intervention. The control and treatment arms have the same random seeds. The code files `35_cost_of_interventions.R`, `40_intervention_effects_on_smoking.R`, `45_intervention_effects_on_mortality.R` and `50_intervention_effects_on_health.R` summarise the main effects of the policy. The summaries presented are all stratified by year and IMD quintile. There are several .Rmd code files that also generate a report of the methods and findings of the code in this repo, which can be found here https://stapm.github.io/smoking_intervention_analysis/ (*but it is still a work in progress*).
