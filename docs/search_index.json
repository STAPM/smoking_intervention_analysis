This report introduces and shows the results of a basic analysis of the cost-effectiveness of smoking interventions. The idea is that this will form the starting point for extensions to specific projects. Developments are still being worked through, so the code and report are likely to change. All of the STAPM code and documentation are still undergoing internal review by the analyst team. At the moment only members of our team are able to run this code because it depends on a number of private R packages. "]
